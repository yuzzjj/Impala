# Variables in the file override the default values from impala-config.sh.
# Config changes for release or features branches should go here so they
# can be version controlled but not conflict with changes on the master
# branch.
#
# E.g. to override IMPALA_HADOOP_VERSION, you could uncomment this line:
# IMPALA_HADOOP_VERSION=3.0.0
