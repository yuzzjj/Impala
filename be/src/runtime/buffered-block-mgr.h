/// The BufferedBlockMgr is used to allocate and manage blocks of data using a fixed memory
/// budget. Available memory is split into a pool of fixed-size memory buffers. When a
/// client allocates or requests a block, the block is assigned a buffer from this pool and
/// is 'pinned' in memory. Clients can also unpin a block, allowing the manager to reassign
/// its buffer to a different block.
//
/// The BufferedBlockMgr typically allocates blocks in IO buffer size to get maximal IO
/// efficiency when spilling. Clients can also request smaller buffers that cannot spill
/// (note that it would be possible to spill small buffers, but we currently do not allow
/// it). This is useful to present the same block API and mem tracking for clients (one can
/// use the block mgr API to mem track non-spillable (smaller) buffers). Clients that do
/// partitioning (e.g. PHJ and PAGG) will start with these smaller buffer sizes to reduce
/// the minimum buffering requirements and grow to max sized buffers as the input grows.
/// For simplicity, these small buffers are not recycled (there's also not really a need
/// since they are allocated all at once on query startup). These buffers are not counted
/// against the reservation.
//
/// The BufferedBlockMgr reserves one buffer per disk ('block_write_threshold_') for
/// itself. When the number of free buffers falls below 'block_write_threshold', unpinned
/// blocks are flushed in Last-In-First-Out order. (It is assumed that unpinned blocks are
/// re-read in FIFO order). The TmpFileMgr is used to obtain file handles to write to
/// within the tmp directories configured for Impala.
//
/// It is expected to have one BufferedBlockMgr per query. All allocations that can grow
/// proportional to the input size and that might need to spill to disk should allocate
/// from the same BufferedBlockMgr.
//
/// A client must pin a block in memory to read/write its contents and unpin it when it is
/// no longer in active use. The BufferedBlockMgr guarantees that:
///  a) The memory buffer assigned to a block is not removed or released while it is pinned.
///  b) The contents of an unpinned block will be available on a subsequent call to pin.
//
/// The Client supports the following operations:
///  GetNewBlock(): Returns a new pinned block.
///  Close(): Frees all memory and disk space. Called when a query is closed or cancelled.
///   Close() is idempotent.
//
/// A Block supports the following operations:
///  Pin(): Pins a block to a buffer in memory, and reads its contents from disk if
///   necessary. If there are no free buffers, waits for a buffer to become available.
///   Invoked before the contents of a block are read or written. The block
///   will be maintained in memory until Unpin() is called.
///  Unpin(): Invoked to indicate the block is not in active use. The block is added to a
///   list of unpinned blocks. Unpinned blocks are only written when the number of free
///   blocks falls below the 'block_write_threshold'.
///  Delete(): Invoked to deallocate a block. The buffer associated with the block is
///   immediately released and its on-disk location (if any) reused. All blocks must be
///   deleted before the block manager is torn down.
///
/// The block manager is thread-safe with the following caveat: A single block cannot be
/// used simultaneously by multiple clients in any capacity.
/// However, the block manager client is not thread-safe. That is, the block manager
/// allows multiple single-threaded block manager clients.
