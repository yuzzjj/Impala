This file was created for:
IMPALA-1881: Maximize data locality when scanning Parquet files with multiple row groups.
IMPALA-2466: Add more tests to the HDFS parquet scanner.

The table lineitem_multiblock is a single parquet file with:
 - A row group size of approximately 12 KB each.
 - 200 row groups in total.

Assuming a 1 MB HDFS block size, it has:
 - 3 blocks of up to 1 MB each.
 - Multiple row groups per block
 - Some row groups that span across block boundaries and live on 2 blocks.

This table was created using hive and has the same table structure and some of the data of
'tpch.lineitem'.

The following commands were used:

create table functional_parquet.lineitem_multiblock like tpch.lineitem
stored as parquet;

set parquet.block.size=4086; # This is to set the row group size

insert into functional_parquet.lineitem_multiblock select * from
tpch.lineitem limit 20000; # We limit to 20000 to keep the size of the table small

'lineitem_sixblocks' was created the same way but with more rows, so that we got more
blocks.

'lineitem_multiblock_one_row_group' was created similarly but with a much higher
'parquet.block.size' so that everything fit in one row group.
