      Third-party products, especially business intelligence and reporting tools, can access Impala
      using the ODBC protocol. For the best experience, ensure any third-party product you intend to use is supported.
      Verifying support includes checking that the versions of Impala, ODBC, the operating system, the
      Apache Hadoop distribution, and the third-party product have all been approved by the appropriate suppliers
      for use together. To configure your systems to use ODBC, download and install a connector, typically from
      the supplier of the third-party product or the Hadoop distribution.
      You may need to sign in and accept license agreements before accessing the pages required for downloading
      ODBC connectors.
