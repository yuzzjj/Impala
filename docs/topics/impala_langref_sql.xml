      The Impala SQL dialect supports a range of standard elements, plus some extensions for Big Data use cases

    <note>
      <p>
        In the <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname> interpreter, a semicolon at the end of each statement is required.
        Since the semicolon is not actually part of the SQL syntax, we do not include it in the syntax definition
