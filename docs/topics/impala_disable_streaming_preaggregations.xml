    <p rev="2.5.0 IMPALA-1305">
      <indexterm audience="hidden">DISABLE_STREAMING_PREAGGREGATIONS query option</indexterm>
      Turns off the <q>streaming preaggregation</q> optimization that is available in <keyword keyref="impala25_full"/>
      and higher. This optimization reduces unnecessary work performed by queries that perform aggregation
      operations on columns with few or no duplicate values, for example <codeph>DISTINCT <varname>id_column</varname></codeph>
      or <codeph>GROUP BY <varname>unique_column</varname></codeph>. If the optimization causes regressions in
      existing queries that use aggregation functions, you can turn it off as needed by setting this query option.

    <p>
      Typically, queries that would require enabling this option involve very large numbers of
      aggregated values, such as a billion or more distinct keys being processed on each
      worker node.
