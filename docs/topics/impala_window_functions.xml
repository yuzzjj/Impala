      Window functions are a special category of built-in functions. They produce one output value for each input
      row, like scalar functions such as <codeph>length()</codeph> or <codeph>substr()</codeph>. Yet like aggregate
      functions, they also examine the contents of multiple input rows to compute each output value.
