  <conbody>

    <p>
      Impala 1.1 comes set up with all the software and settings needed to enable security when you run the
      <cmdname>impalad</cmdname> daemon with the new security-related options (<codeph>-server_name</codeph> and
      <codeph>-authorization_policy_file</codeph>). You do not need to change any environment variables or install
      any additional JAR files.
