    <p>
      Upgrading Impala involves building or acquiring new Impala-related binaries,
      and then restarting Impala services.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Shut down all Impala-related daemons on
            all relevant hosts in the cluster:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Stop <codeph>impalad</codeph> on each Impala node in your cluster:
<codeblock>$ sudo service impala-server stop</codeblock>
            </li>

            <li>
              Stop any instances of the state store in your cluster:
<codeblock>$ sudo service impala-state-store stop</codeblock>
            </li>

            <li rev="1.2">
              Stop any instances of the catalog service in your cluster:
<codeblock>$ sudo service impala-catalog stop</codeblock>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Follow the build procedure in the
            <filepath>README.md</filepath> file
            to produce new Impala binaries.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Replace the binaries for all Impala-related
            daemons on all relevant hosts in the cluster.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Check if there are new recommended or required configuration settings to put into place in the
          configuration files, typically under <filepath>/etc/impala/conf</filepath>. See
          <xref href="impala_config_performance.xml#config_performance"/> for settings related to performance and
          scalability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Restart all Impala-related daemons on
            all relevant hosts in the cluster:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Restart the Impala state store service on the desired nodes in your cluster. Expect to see a process
              named <codeph>statestored</codeph> if the service started successfully.
<codeblock>$ sudo service impala-state-store start
$ ps ax | grep [s]tatestored
 6819 ?        Sl     0:07 /usr/lib/impala/sbin/statestored -log_dir=/var/log/impala -state_store_port=24000
</codeblock>
              <p>
                Restart the state store service <i>before</i> the Impala server service to avoid <q>Not
                connected</q> errors when you run <codeph>impala-shell</codeph>.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li rev="1.2">
              Restart the Impala catalog service on whichever host it runs on in your cluster. Expect to see a
              process named <codeph>catalogd</codeph> if the service started successfully.
<codeblock>$ sudo service impala-catalog restart
$ ps ax | grep [c]atalogd
 6068 ?        Sl     4:06 /usr/lib/impala/sbin/catalogd
</codeblock>
            </li>

            <li>
              Restart the Impala daemon service on each node in your cluster. Expect to see a process named
              <codeph>impalad</codeph> if the service started successfully.
<codeblock>$ sudo service impala-server start
$ ps ax | grep [i]mpalad
 7936 ?        Sl     0:12 /usr/lib/impala/sbin/impalad -log_dir=/var/log/impala -state_store_port=24000

      <note>
        <p>
          If the services did not start successfully (even though the <codeph>sudo service</codeph> command might
          display <codeph>[OK]</codeph>), check for errors in the Impala log file, typically in
          <filepath>/var/log/impala</filepath>.
