      <indexterm audience="hidden">SUPPORT_START_OVER query option</indexterm>
      Leave this setting at its default value.
      It is a read-only setting, tested by some client applications such as Hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you accidentally change it through <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname>,
      subsequent queries encounter errors until you undo the change
      by issuing <codeph>UNSET support_start_over</codeph>.
