    <p>
      It is important to secure the Hive metastore, so that users cannot access the names or other information
      about databases and tables the through the Hive client or by querying the metastore database. Do this by
      turning on Hive metastore security, using the instructions in
      <xref keyref="cdh_sg_hive_security"/> for securing different Hive components:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Secure the Hive Metastore.
      </li>

      <li>
        In addition, allow access to the metastore only from the HiveServer2 server, and then disable local access
        to the HiveServer2 server.
      </li>
    </ul>
