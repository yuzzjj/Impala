      <p>
        Impala provides fast, interactive SQL queries directly on your Apache Hadoop data stored in HDFS,
        HBase, <ph rev="2.2.0">or the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</ph>.
        In addition to using the same unified storage platform,
        Impala also uses the same metadata, SQL syntax (Hive SQL), ODBC driver, and user interface
        (Impala query UI in Hue) as Apache Hive. This
        provides a familiar and unified platform for real-time or batch-oriented queries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Impala is an addition to tools available for querying big data. Impala does not replace the batch
        processing frameworks built on MapReduce such as Hive. Hive and other frameworks built on MapReduce are
        best suited for long running batch jobs, such as those involving batch processing of Extract, Transform,
        and Load (ETL) type jobs.
      </p>

      <note>
        Impala was accepted into the Apache incubator on December 2, 2015.
        In places where the documentation formerly referred to <q>Cloudera Impala</q>,
        now the official name is <q>Apache Impala (incubating)</q>.
